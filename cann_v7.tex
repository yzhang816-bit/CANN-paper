\section{Ablation Study (RQ2)}
\subsection{Setup}
We evaluate the contribution of each component of the redesigned, resource-aware CANN on the Cora dataset. To isolate geometric effects and ensure fairness:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CANN_Full uses curvature-enhanced attention with normalized curvature concatenated to features, multi-head attention (4 heads), hidden 64, dropout 0.5, trained for 150 epochs with early stopping by validation.
    \item Variants remove specific components and are trained under reduced capacity (heads 1--2, hidden 8--32, dropout 0.7--0.9) for 40--80 epochs to avoid inadvertently matching the full model capacity.
    \item All runs use identical splits and optimizer settings.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Results}

\textbf{Variant} & \textbf{Train} & \textbf{Val} & \textbf{Test} \\

CANN (Full) & \textbf{0.993} & \textbf{0.784} & \textbf{0.786} \\
w/o Curvature & 0.229 & 0.318 & 0.322 \\
w/o Attention & 0.271 & 0.462 & 0.438 \\

w/o Coupling & 0.429 & 0.346 & 0.360 \\
Random Curvature & 0.586 & 0.516 & 0.523 \\

\caption{Ablation on Cora under resource-aware settings. The full CANN (curvature-enhanced multi-head attention with coupling) achieves the strongest validation and test performance. Removing curvature, attention, or their coupling substantially degrades generalization.}

\subsection{Analysis}
- CANN_Full achieves the highest validation and test accuracy, confirming that curvature-attention coupling is essential for generalization.
- Removing curvature collapses performance (test 0.322), demonstrating the geometric signal is critical beyond feature-only aggregation.
- Removing attention or using uniform/shuffled curvature prevents adaptive weighting and geometry-feature interaction, yielding notably weaker results.
- The capacity-controlled design avoids attributing gains to parameter count; improvements arise from principled geometric conditioning.
